Task 1 — Evaluate Lighting Effectiveness on the Subject: Examine the photograph and determine how well the light reveals the cat. Assess whether the cat's form, features, and texture — its fur, ears, eyes, and body contour — are clearly visible and legible to the viewer. Identify lighting failures such as harsh shadows that fragment the cat's features into unreadable shapes, overexposure that bleaches away the detail of light-colored fur, or underexposure that buries the cat in darkness. The standard is functional revelation: the light does not need to be perfect or dramatic, but it must do enough work that a viewer can perceive the cat without effort or strain. A slightly dim room where the cat's face is still clearly discernible scores well; a bright scene where the cat is reduced to a featureless silhouette does not. Score how effectively the light serves its primary purpose of showing us the cat.

Task 2 — Evaluate Background Cleanliness and Distraction Level: Shift attention to everything in the photograph that is not the cat and assess whether the surrounding environment recedes gracefully behind the subject or surges forward to compete with it for the viewer's attention. A clean background is not necessarily an empty one — soft, muted elements that remain subordinate to the cat are perfectly acceptable, and a richly detailed setting can score well if its elements are blurred or tonally harmonious. What matters is whether the background fragments the viewer's attention or allows it to settle naturally on the cat. Identify visual clutter, competing points of interest, bright or high-contrast objects that pull the eye away from the subject, and any environmental element that forces the cat to fight for the attention it should receive freely. Score how well the background and surrounding space defer to the cat as the subject.

Task 3 — Evaluate Overall Harmony Between the Cat and Its Environment: Step back and assess the photograph as a unified visual scene, evaluating how the lighting and the environment come together around the cat to create a coherent, inviting experience. This task captures what the first two tasks cannot capture alone — the holistic feeling of the photograph. A scene where the light, textures, colors, and spatial relationships all converge to make the cat feel like it belongs in its setting represents harmony. A scene where the cat is technically visible against a technically uncluttered background but where the color temperature clashes, the spatial relationship feels awkward, or the overall mood is fractured represents disharmony. Consider whether every element in the frame seems to breathe together in service of the subject, or whether the photograph feels disjointed despite its individual parts being adequate. Score how cohesively the photograph's visual world supports the cat as the subject of a quiet, coherent scene.
