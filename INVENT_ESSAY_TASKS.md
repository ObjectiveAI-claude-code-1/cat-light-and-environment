Task 1: Evaluate how effectively the lighting in the photograph reveals the cat as a subject. Determine whether the light, regardless of its source or style, allows the viewer to clearly see the cat's features, including the texture of its fur, the shape of its face, the depth of its eyes, and the contour of its body. The cat's details should be present and legible without the viewer needing to strain. Penalize lighting failures that obscure the cat: harsh overexposure that washes fur into featureless white, deep shadows that absorb the cat into darkness and make it indistinguishable from its surroundings, unnatural color casts that distort the appearance of the fur, and extreme glare or hot spots that pull the eye away from the animal. Reward light that functionally serves the act of showing the cat to the viewer, whether that light is humble and utilitarian or naturally beautiful. A flat even light that clearly illuminates the cat scores well. A dramatic light that turns the cat into an unreadable silhouette does not. Effectiveness is measured by visibility and clarity, not by beauty or mood.

Task 2: Evaluate how clean and distraction-free the background and surrounding space are in relation to the cat. Determine whether the non-subject elements in the photograph recede to let the cat command attention or compete with the cat for the viewer's eye. A clean background is not necessarily an empty one; it is one where the visual information behind and around the cat supports the cat's presence rather than fragmenting it. Penalize backgrounds that pile up visual noise and pull focus away from the subject: cluttered objects, competing colors and busy patterns, visible text on packaging, other animals partially in frame, and bright or attention-grabbing elements that rival the cat. Reward backgrounds that settle the eye naturally on the cat, whether that background is a simple painted wall, soft garden greenery, or a lived-in space with a calm visual rhythm. The question is whether the space around the cat acts as a setting that supports the subject or a rival that dilutes it.

Task 3: Evaluate the overall harmony between the cat and the visual world of the photograph as a whole. Determine whether light, space, color, and subject feel like they are participating in one coherent image rather than existing in tension with each other. Harmony is the sense that the cat belongs in its visual surroundings and that all elements quietly agree to present the cat as the natural focal point. Penalize dissonance between elements: harsh flash lighting in an otherwise dark and moody room, a cat awkwardly placed against a background with no visual relationship to the subject, or extreme contrasts between the mood of the lighting and the mood of the setting that unsettle the viewer. Reward coherence, the feeling that the warmth of the light matches the warmth of the scene, that the intimacy or openness of the setting matches the character of the moment, and that every part of the image exists in quiet agreement. Harmony is not about the prestige or beauty of the environment. A cat on a plain concrete step in even daylight can feel deeply harmonious while a cat in an extravagant room can feel chaotic. This task captures the holistic unity of the image that neither lighting effectiveness nor background cleanliness can express alone.
