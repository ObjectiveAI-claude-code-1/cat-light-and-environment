1. Evaluate how effectively the lighting in the photograph reveals the cat as a subject. Examine whether the light allows the viewer to clearly see the cat's face, fur texture, and body form without straining. Determine if the cat is free from harsh overexposure that washes out detail into featureless white, deep shadows that swallow the cat into darkness and reduce it to a silhouette, or distracting artifacts like extreme glare and unnatural color casts. The light does not need to be studio-perfect — it needs to be functional, working for the cat by making it visible and appreciable rather than working against it by hiding, distorting, or overwhelming its physical presence.

2. Evaluate how clean and non-distracting the background and surrounding space are in relation to the cat. Examine whether the cat stands out clearly as the subject of the photograph or whether it is lost in a visual crowd of competing elements. Determine if scattered objects, bold patterns, bright signage, other animals, or a general tangle of visual information behind and around the cat fractures the viewer's focus and pulls attention away from the subject. The background does not need to be empty or sterile — a bookshelf, a garden, or a kitchen counter can serve well — but it must remain visually secondary to the cat, respecting the subject's role as the center of attention rather than competing with it.

3. Evaluate the overall harmony between the cat, the light, and the surrounding environment as a unified visual experience. Examine whether the photograph feels settled, coherent, and inviting as a whole — whether the cat appears to exist comfortably within its visual world, with all elements of the scene speaking the same visual language. Determine if there are jarring mismatches between the subject and its setting, such as a warmly colored cat under cold and clinical light, or a calm subject placed within a visually chaotic space that fights it rather than cradles it. Harmony does not require beauty or prestige in the setting — a humble room with consistent gentle light can radiate harmony — but it does require that the visual elements of the photograph feel unified in their service to the cat.
