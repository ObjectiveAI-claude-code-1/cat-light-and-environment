Task 1 – Evaluate Lighting Effectiveness on the Subject: Examine how well the light in the photograph reveals the cat. Determine whether the cat's key features — its face, eyes, fur texture, color, and body form — are visible and legible to the viewer. Consider whether the lighting allows the cat to be seen clearly and naturally, regardless of the light source. Identify lighting failures that work against the subject: overexposure that washes the cat into a featureless shape, underexposure that buries the cat in shadow, extreme contrast that splits the cat into zones of blinding brightness and impenetrable darkness, and unnatural color casts that distort the cat's true appearance. The central question this task answers is purely functional: does the light let a viewer look at this photograph and understand what the cat looks like?

Task 2 – Evaluate Background Cleanliness and Distraction Level: Examine the visual territory behind and around the cat and determine whether it competes with the cat for the viewer's attention. A background does not need to be empty, blurred, or professionally arranged — it simply needs to be calm enough that the viewer's eye lands on the cat and stays there. Identify backgrounds that are visually noisy: those packed with bright objects, busy patterns, competing colors, crowds of shapes, or other elements that fracture attention and reduce the cat to just one more item in a chaotic scene. Assess this quality relative to each photograph's own setting — a garden, a kitchen, or a living room can each be either calm or cluttered depending on how the specific scene presents itself. The central question this task answers is: when looking at this photograph, does the eye go to the cat, or does it wander?

Task 3 – Evaluate Overall Harmony Between Subject and Setting: Step back from the individual assessments of light and background and evaluate whether the photograph, taken as a whole, feels harmonious. Determine whether the lighting and the environment are not just individually acceptable but are working together to create a coherent, inviting visual experience where the cat feels like it belongs. Identify disharmony where the qualities pull in different directions — such as good lighting undermined by a visually aggressive background, or a clean background sabotaged by poor lighting — as well as subtler forms of disharmony like unwelcoming color temperatures, compositions that marginalize the cat within the frame, or settings so sterile they strip away the warmth of the living subject. The central question this task answers is: does this photograph feel like a place where a cat can be seen and appreciated, where the visual world welcomes the subject rather than working against it?
