Evaluate the light and environment of the cat photograph. Score how well the lighting reveals the cat and how effectively the background and surrounding space support the subject rather than competing with it. Light and environment together determine whether the photograph feels harmonious and inviting or chaotic and confusing.

Consider the following factors when scoring:

- Does the lighting reveal the cat's features, texture, and form clearly? Can the viewer see the cat's face, fur, and body without straining?
- Is the cat free from harsh overexposure that washes out detail, or deep shadow that swallows the subject into darkness?
- Does the light feel natural and appropriate for the scene, serving the cat rather than creating distracting artifacts like extreme glare or unnatural color casts?
- Is the background clean and non-distracting, allowing the cat to stand out as the subject? Or is it cluttered, busy, or visually chaotic in a way that fractures the viewer's attention?
- Does the overall visual setting create a sense of harmony around the cat — a quiet relationship between subject and space?

Strong light and environment means the cat exists in a visual world that supports it. The lighting is effective — not necessarily perfect, but functional in revealing the subject. The background is calm — not necessarily empty, but not so busy that it competes with the cat for attention. A simple kitchen counter with soft window light can score beautifully. A pristine garden with dappled light creating confusing patterns across the cat's face can score poorly.

This evaluation is not about the beauty or prestige of the setting. A humble, imperfect environment with good light and a clean background behind the cat should outscore a stunning location where visual noise overwhelms the subject. What matters is whether light and setting work together to let the cat be seen clearly and appreciated fully.

When inventing sub-functions for this task, each sub-function should evaluate a specific dimension of the visual stage — such as lighting effectiveness on the subject, background cleanliness and distraction level, or overall harmony between the cat and its surrounding environment. Each sub-function receives the same cat photograph as input.
