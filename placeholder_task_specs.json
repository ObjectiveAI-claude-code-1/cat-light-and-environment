    "spec": "Evaluate the lighting effectiveness on the cat as subject. Examine how the light in the photograph falls on the cat and determine whether it reveals or obscures the cat's features, texture, and form. Consider whether the cat's face is visible, whether the eyes can be seen, and whether the fur is rendered with enough detail to convey its texture and dimension. Identify problems such as deep shadows that swallow the cat's face or body, harsh overexposure that washes out fur and erases detail, extreme backlighting that reduces the cat to a silhouette, or unnatural color casts that distort the cat's appearance. The standard is not perfect or professional lighting — it is functional lighting. A slightly dim photograph where the cat's features are still discernible scores better than a brightly lit photograph where glare obliterates the cat's face. Score how well the light, whatever its source or character, does its job of making the cat visible, clear, and comfortable to look at. High scores mean the light reveals the cat generously. Low scores mean the light fails to make the cat visible — the subject is lost in shadow, blown out by overexposure, reduced to silhouette by backlighting, or distorted by unnatural color casts.",

    "spec": "Evaluate the background cleanliness and distraction level in the cat photograph. Examine the space surrounding the cat — everything that is not the cat itself — and determine whether it remains visually subordinate to the subject or whether it competes for the viewer's attention. A clean background is not necessarily an empty one; it is one that occupies space without demanding focus, that may add warmth or context but does not shout. Identify distractions such as cluttered surfaces covered in objects of varying colors and shapes, busy scenes with competing visual elements, or aggressive patterns that merge with the cat's form and make it difficult to distinguish subject from setting. The evaluation is not about perfection but about degree. A moderately busy background where the cat still clearly reads as the subject is acceptable. A background so chaotic that the cat disappears into visual noise is a failure. Score how effectively the background allows the cat to stand out as the clear subject of the photograph. High scores mean the background is calm and supportive — the cat commands attention naturally. Low scores mean the background is cluttered, chaotic, or visually loud, fracturing the viewer's focus and competing with the cat for attention.",

    "spec": "Evaluate the overall harmony between the cat and its surrounding environment in the photograph. Step back from individual assessments of light and background and examine the photograph as a unified visual experience. Determine whether the light and environment come together to create a coherent, settled feeling — whether the light complements the setting, the colors in the environment work with rather than against the cat's appearance, and the overall mood of the image feels consistent rather than contradictory. Identify disharmony such as a mismatch between the emotional tone of the lighting and the setting, a color palette in the surroundings that visually overwhelms the cat's coloring, or a fragmented quality where different elements of the image seem to belong to different photographs. The cat should look like it belongs in this space, and the space should feel like it was made to hold this cat. Score how well the photograph produces a sense of visual ease and unity. High scores mean the image feels settled and harmonious — light, environment, and cat exist as one coherent visual world. Low scores mean the visual elements feel at odds, creating a fragmented or uneasy impression where the cat and its surroundings seem to belong to different photographs.",
