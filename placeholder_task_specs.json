    "spec": "Evaluate how effectively the lighting in the cat photograph reveals the cat as a subject. Score how well the light allows the viewer to clearly see the cat's face, fur texture, and body form without straining. Penalize harsh overexposure that washes out detail into featureless white, deep shadows that swallow the cat into darkness and reduce it to a silhouette, and distracting lighting artifacts like extreme glare or unnatural color casts. The standard is functional lighting — light that works for the cat by making it visible and appreciable. Studio-perfect lighting is not required; soft window light, overcast sky glow, or warm ambient room light all qualify as effective if they reveal the cat clearly. What matters is whether the light serves the cat — illuminating its physical presence with enough clarity for the viewer to see and appreciate it — or fails it by hiding, distorting, or overwhelming its features.",

    "spec": "Evaluate how clean and non-distracting the background and surrounding space are in relation to the cat. Score whether the cat stands out clearly as the subject of the photograph or whether it is lost in a visual crowd of competing elements. Penalize scattered objects, bold patterns, bright signage, other animals, or a general tangle of visual information behind and around the cat that fractures the viewer's focus and pulls attention away from the subject. The background does not need to be empty or sterile — a bookshelf, a garden, or a kitchen counter can serve well — but it must remain visually secondary to the cat. What matters is visual hierarchy: does the surrounding space respect the cat's role as the center of attention, allowing the viewer's eye to settle naturally on the subject, or does it compete with the cat, creating a cluttered and chaotic visual field where the subject is difficult to isolate and appreciate?",

    "spec": "Evaluate the overall harmony between the cat, the light, and the surrounding environment as a unified visual experience. Score whether the photograph feels settled, coherent, and inviting as a whole — whether the cat appears to exist comfortably within its visual world, with all elements of the scene speaking the same visual language. Penalize jarring mismatches between the subject and its setting, such as a warmly colored cat under cold and clinical light, a calm subject placed within a visually chaotic space that fights it rather than cradles it, or any sense that the visual elements of the photograph are working against each other rather than cooperating. Harmony does not require beauty or prestige in the setting — a humble room with consistent gentle light can radiate harmony — but it does require that the visual elements of the photograph feel unified in their service to the cat. This is the holistic quality: not just whether the light works or the background is clean in isolation, but whether everything in the frame cooperates to create a coherent visual stage for the subject.",
