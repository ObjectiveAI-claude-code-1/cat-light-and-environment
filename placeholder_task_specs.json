    "spec": "Evaluate the lighting effectiveness on the cat subject in a photograph. Score how well the light reveals the cat — whether the cat's key features (face, eyes, fur texture, color, and body form) are visible and legible to the viewer.\n\nEffective lighting means the cat can be seen clearly and naturally, regardless of the light source. Soft window light, overcast sky glow, or the warm spill of a table lamp can all score well if they make the cat readable. What matters is that the light reaches the subject and makes its features discernible.\n\nScore poorly when lighting fails the subject:\n- Overexposure that washes the cat into a featureless white shape, destroying fur texture and facial definition\n- Underexposure that buries the cat in darkness, making the viewer strain to see the subject\n- Extreme contrast that splits the cat into zones of blinding brightness and impenetrable shadow, preventing the animal from being appreciated as a whole\n- Unnatural color casts (sickly greens from fluorescent bulbs, aggressive orange from tungsten) that distort the cat's true appearance\n\nScore highly when lighting serves the subject:\n- The cat's face is clearly visible — eyes, nose, whiskers, and expression are legible\n- Fur texture, color, and patterns can be seen and appreciated\n- The cat's body form and posture are perceptible within the frame\n- The light feels natural and appropriate, neither too harsh nor too dim\n\nThis is a purely functional evaluation. The question is not whether the lighting is artistic or dramatic, but whether it lets a viewer look at the photograph and understand what the cat looks like. A humble lamp that clearly illuminates the cat should outscore dramatic golden-hour light that overexposes or casts confusing shadows across the subject.",

    "spec": "Evaluate the background cleanliness and distraction level in a cat photograph. Score how well the visual territory behind and around the cat supports the subject by staying calm and non-competitive, allowing the viewer's eye to land on the cat and remain there.\n\nA clean background does not need to be empty, white, or blurred into bokeh. It simply needs to be calm enough that it does not compete with the cat for the viewer's attention. A plain wall, a simple bedspread, or a muted desk where objects recede naturally can all score well. What matters is that the cat stands out as the clear subject of the photograph.\n\nScore poorly when the background distracts:\n- Visually noisy backgrounds packed with bright objects, busy patterns, competing colors, or crowds of shapes that fracture the viewer's attention\n- Backgrounds where the cat becomes just one more element in a chaotic visual field rather than the obvious subject\n- Cluttered scenes with tangles of wires, piles of bright toys, bold wallpaper patterns, or other high-contrast elements that pull the eye away from the cat\n- Backgrounds where strong colors, shapes, or lighting compete directly with the cat for visual dominance\n\nScore highly when the background supports:\n- The viewer's eye naturally goes to the cat and stays there without wandering\n- Background elements are muted, receded, or visually subordinate to the cat\n- The surrounding space feels calm and allows the cat to be the focal point\n- Even in imperfect real-world settings, the background does not actively fight the subject for attention\n\nThis evaluation is relative to each photograph's own setting. A garden, kitchen, or living room can each be either calm or cluttered depending on how the specific scene presents itself. The question is never whether the location is prestigious or professionally arranged, but whether the background lets the cat stand out. A messy room where the cat happens to be positioned against a clear section of wall can score well; a beautiful outdoor scene where dappled light and overlapping foliage create visual chaos behind the cat can score poorly.",

    "spec": "Evaluate the overall harmony between the cat subject and its surrounding visual setting in a photograph. Step back from the individual dimensions of lighting and background and score whether the photograph, taken as a whole, feels harmonious — whether light and environment are not just individually acceptable but are working together to create a coherent, inviting visual experience where the cat feels like it belongs.\n\nHarmony is the quiet relationship between all elements of the frame. A cat sitting in a patch of warm sunlight on a wooden floor has harmony — the light, the setting, and the subject all belong to the same moment. A cat on a windowsill with soft diffused light and a simple view behind it has harmony. The elements cooperate rather than clash.\n\nScore poorly when disharmony is present:\n- Good lighting undermined by a visually aggressive background, where strong light cannot save the image from visual chaos behind the cat\n- A clean background sabotaged by poor lighting, where the cat is barely visible despite an uncluttered setting\n- Unwelcoming color temperatures that make the scene feel cold, sterile, or uninviting\n- Compositions that marginalize the cat within the frame — squeezing it into a corner while empty or distracting space dominates\n- Settings so sterile and artificial that the warmth of the living animal is lost\n- Any combination where the individual qualities of light and background pull in conflicting directions\n\nScore highly when harmony is present:\n- Light and background work together seamlessly to present the cat as the welcomed subject of a coherent scene\n- The photograph feels like a natural, unified moment rather than a collision of competing visual forces\n- The cat appears to belong in its environment — the visual world around it supports rather than rejects the subject\n- Color temperatures, spatial composition, and overall mood create a sense of quiet invitation for the viewer\n\nThis is the most holistic of the three evaluations. It captures the emergent quality that arises when light and environment cooperate — or the tension that appears when they do not. A photograph where both lighting and background are merely adequate but work in beautiful concert should outscore one where lighting is excellent but the setting undermines it, or vice versa. The central question is: does this photograph feel like a place where a cat can be seen and appreciated?",
