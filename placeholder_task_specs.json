    "spec": "Evaluate the lighting effectiveness on the cat subject in the photograph. Determine how well the light reveals the cat's form, features, and texture — its fur, ears, eyes, and body contour — so that they are clearly visible and legible to the viewer.\n\nScore highly when the lighting functionally reveals the cat. The light does not need to be perfect, dramatic, or professional — it simply must do enough work that a viewer can perceive the cat's features without effort or strain. A slightly dim room where the cat's face is still clearly discernible scores well. A bright afternoon where the cat is evenly lit scores well. Soft, diffused light that gently illuminates the cat's fur texture and facial features scores well.\n\nScore poorly when the lighting fails to reveal the cat. Harsh shadows that fragment the cat's features into unreadable shapes score poorly. Overexposure that bleaches away the detail of light-colored fur, washing the cat into a white void, scores poorly. Underexposure that buries the cat in darkness, turning it into a featureless silhouette or shadow, scores poorly. Extreme backlighting that reduces the cat to a dark outline against a bright background scores poorly. Unnatural color casts or extreme glare that obscure the cat's true appearance score poorly.\n\nThe standard is functional revelation: can the viewer see the cat's face, the texture of its fur, the shape of its body? If yes, the light is doing its job. If no, the light has failed the subject.",

    "spec": "Evaluate the background cleanliness and distraction level in the cat photograph. Shift attention to everything in the photograph that is not the cat and assess whether the surrounding environment recedes gracefully behind the subject or surges forward to compete with it for the viewer's attention.\n\nScore highly when the background allows the viewer's attention to settle naturally on the cat. A clean background is not necessarily an empty one — soft, muted elements that remain subordinate to the cat are perfectly acceptable. A richly detailed garden can score well if its elements are softly blurred or tonally harmonious. A simple kitchen counter, a plain wall, a couch with muted cushions — these all score well when they stay quiet and let the cat be the subject. What matters is that nothing in the surrounding space pulls the viewer's eye away from the cat.\n\nScore poorly when the background fragments the viewer's attention or competes with the cat for visual priority. Visual clutter — scattered objects, multiple bright or high-contrast elements, busy patterns — scores poorly. Competing points of interest such as other animals, people, screens, or bright signage that draw the eye away from the cat score poorly. Chaotic environments where the cat must fight for the attention it should receive freely score poorly. Even a simple background can score poorly if harsh light casts jagged, distracting shadows across it.\n\nThe standard is visual deference: does the background and surrounding space let the cat stand out as the clear subject, or does it force the cat to compete for the viewer's attention?",

    "spec": "Evaluate the overall harmony between the cat and its surrounding environment in the photograph. Step back and assess the photograph as a unified visual scene, evaluating how the lighting and the environment come together around the cat to create a coherent, inviting experience. This task captures what the lighting and background evaluations cannot capture alone — the holistic feeling of the photograph as a whole.\n\nScore highly when the photograph feels like a coherent, unified scene where the cat belongs. A scene where the light, textures, colors, and spatial relationships all converge to make the cat feel naturally at home in its setting represents harmony. A cat curled on a sun-warmed windowsill where warm light, soft textures, and a quiet background all breathe together in service of the subject scores highly. A cat resting on a bed where the color palette, lighting warmth, and spatial composition create a gentle, inviting mood scores highly. What matters is that every element in the frame feels like it belongs together, creating a quiet visual world centered on the cat.\n\nScore poorly when the photograph feels disjointed or uncomfortable despite its individual parts being adequate. A cat that is technically visible against a technically uncluttered background but where the color temperature clashes with the setting, the spatial relationship between cat and environment feels awkward, or the overall mood is fractured scores poorly. A cat in a parking lot under fluorescent light with a dumpster behind it, where nothing in the frame seems to relate to anything else, scores poorly. Environments where the atmosphere feels hostile, jarring, or incoherent around the cat score poorly.\n\nThe standard is cohesion: does the photograph's visual world feel like a place where the cat can be seen, appreciated, and understood as the subject of a quiet, coherent scene? Or does it feel fragmented, with disparate elements that never come together into a unified whole?",
